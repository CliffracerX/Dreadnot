# Dreadnot
## A Dreadnought clone initially made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 40
What if Dreadnought let you build your own ships?  What if those ships could be so complicated you needed your friends to serve onboard as bridge crew?  This is the central idea for Dreadnot.  Building your own Dreadnought-style ships.

The initial construction system and core mechanics were thrown together in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 40.  The rest of the game was built on afterwards.

###CURRENT STATE
 * Ship piloting: YES
 * Abilities/modules: YES
 * Construction system: WIP
   * You can technically build any ship out of the 24 available blocks now.  The loading/spawning system is fully functional.
   * The ingame editor, however, is not.
